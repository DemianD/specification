# Traversing Node elements

When a `tree:Node` element is found, its `tree:value` __must__ be set. The object of `tree:value` __should__ be accompanied by a data type when it is a literal value.

The `tree:Node` element __may__ also have one or more `tree:childRelation`. A child relation is an entity of the type `tree:ChildRelation`, and __may__ have one or more more specific types. A `tree:ChildRelation` __must__ have one or more `tree:child` objects of the type `tree:Node`. In this description in all documents, this child __must__ contain a `tree:value`. If a particular child is flagged interesting after evaluating the relation, then this childâ€™s URL needs to be followed.

Every `tree:Node` _should_ contain a `shacl:path` to indicate on what exact triple(s) the `tree:value` applies. For the different ways to express or handle a `shacl:path`, we refer to [2.3.1 in the schacl specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#x2.3.1-shacl-property-paths). Mind that all possible combinations of e.g., `sh:alternativePath` or `sh:inversePath` may be used. When `sh:alternativePath` is used, the order in the list will define the importance of the order when evaluating the `tree:ChildRelation`. If no `shacl:path` is provided in this document, the `tree:value` must be interpreted as filtering all objects that can be compared against the `tree:value`.

Every node __may__ provide a `tree:remainingItems`. A client __may__ use `tree:remainingItems` to estimate the completeness of the downloaded elements.

## ChildRelations

When the _only_ type given for a certain ChildRelation is `tree:ChildRelation`, then the client must dereference all of its children. While this may seem useless, it can be used for the same use case as a `hydra:PartialCollectionView`.

Other types:
 - `tree:StringCompletesRelation` - In order to find a string, you must concatenate the value of this node with the value of the parent node, and its former parents that were linked through this relation.
 - `tree:GreaterThanRelation` and the likes - You must evaluate the value against the relation as defined by this relation. Number evaluation is straightforward. String comparisons will be further defined in Chapter 4.
 - Interval relations _TODO_ - see vocabulary for now
 - Geographic relations _TODO_ - see vocabulary for now

### Comparing strings according to a locale

When comparing strings, different strategies can be applied. Bytestring or depending on a specific locale.

_TODO: define different strategies_

# Traversing geospatial tiles

When a tile is found through tree:latitudeTile, tree:longitudeTile and tree:zoom, other elements can be found in two ways:
 1. Through a description of other elements in the collection
 2. A search form is exposed and all other URLs to tiles in a viewport or bounding box can be calculated

This text is for the first option. See the [Search spec](3-search.md) for the second option.
