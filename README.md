# The Tree Ontology ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ´ prune your search space

The ðŸŒ² Tree Ontology allows client developers to download all members of a collection _they need_. Each document or node describes links to other nodes by describing a comparison with a value.

Web API builders can use this specification to fragment a collection of items over multiple documents as an alternative to a [hydra:PartialCollectionView](https://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/#collections).

## The Vocabulary

Base URI to be used: `https://w3id.org/tree#`

Preferred prefixes: `tree:` or `tiles:` (the latter makes sense if you only use the geospatial tiling specific terms) 

The full vocabulary is explained in the [vocabulary.md](vocabulary.md).

Simple overview:

## Application profiles

A couple of formal application profiles exist for specific use cases. Application profiles can be implemented by clients to understand specific hypermedia building blocks using the [vocabulary](vocabulary.md).

 * Building block 1: [Discovery](specs/1-discovery.md)
     * 1.1: discovering a `tree:Node` through `tree:view`
     * 1.2: discovering a page is part of a larger `hydra:Collection` through `dcterms:isPartOf` and `void:subset` (and then building block 1 can be used again)
 * Building block 2: [Traversing](specs/2-traversing.md) a `tree:Node`â€™s `tree:relation` for more specific information
 * Building block 3: [Search forms](specs/3-search.md)
      * 3.1: using a search form for geospatial tiles cfr. OpenStreetMap tiles
      * 3.2: using a search form to redirect to a Node containing the element
 * Building block 4: [Provenance and Summaries](specs/4-provenance-and-summaries.md)

Mind that a server exposing data through the Tree Ontology __must__ [set the CORS headers](http://enable-cors.org) to allow any host.

In order to write a full Tree Ontology compliant client, you need to implement all building blocks, as well as the [Hydra partial collection view spec](). [Comunica](https://github.com/comunica/comunica) and its hypermedia actors (todo) is our main reference implementation.

See the [specs](specs/) folder for more information.

Different examples of datasets, implementing different mixes of building blocks, can be found in the [examples](examples/) folder.

### Implementations

Neat examples can be found here:

 * Autocompletion and geo-spatial search prototype: https://dexagod.github.io
 * Routable tiles for routing over a geospatially tiled road network:
     - The initial paper: http://pieter.pm/demo-paper-routable-tiles/
     - Calculating an isochrone demo with user-feedback while querying: http://hdelva.be/isochrone/demo.html

Also in the example folder in here, weâ€™ve taken the effort to illustrate a couple of use cases:
 * [An ordered collection of pages](examples/paged-collection-with-order/)
 
## Questions and Answers

### Why publish a hypermedia Tree?

When a document grows too large for 1 HTTP response, we need to fragment it. The way we fragment it will immediatly decide what queries will be fast and which queries will be slow.
Hypermedia trees are a tool to hit the sweet spot between data dumps and querying APIs (such as GraphQL or SPARQL). It is particularly a sweet spot for Open Data publishers that need a cost-efficient way of publishing their data, while allowing third parties to create serverless applications to reuse the data.

|   | dump  | tree fragments  | query  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| processing | client | shared | server |
| server cost  | low  | okay  | high  |
|  client cost | high  | okay  | low  |
| caching | low | high | low |
| query execution control | high | high | low |

### Why hypermedia?

When you write a client for one server, you can get away with hard-coding the way the API is built based on the API specification. When building a client for the entire Web, we need to make very general specifications that still allow our client to understand what it can do next. The latter are called the hypermedia controls.

### What are triples? JSON-LD? RDF? URIs? Linked Data?

Same idea as hypermedia, only for understanding the elements in the pages itself. See [these intro slides](https://speakerdeck.com/pietercolpaert/an-introduction-to-open-data), or [read this chapter](https://phd.pietercolpaert.be/chapters/data-and-interoperability).
